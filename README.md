# ML5 SFPC Workshop

This one day workshop will be focused on doing deep learning in the browser with javascript. We will use ML5.js, an experimental library that does not require any setup tools or complicated frameworks to install. This will be a beginners friendly workshop and no previous knowledge of machine learning is require. Although, some basic experience with javascript would be helpful.

## Setup

1. Clone or Download the repo from [here](https://github.com/cvalenzuela/sfpc/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.

2. Change directory into the folder and start a server (See "How to Setup a Server")

3. All files have instructions.

### How to Setup a Server

The easiest way is with python:

In python 2:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

In python 3:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

With node: 
```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

And then run:

```bash
live-server
```

This will reload when files are changed.
